# TypeScript Port of AvanRocks/3d-game-thing

Run `ts-node game.ts` to try it out :)

## Original Code

The `upstream` folder contains the original README and LICENSE

There's an `upstream-python` too by GeeTransit but the Python code was too cryptic so I based my implementation off the original C++ code instead.
